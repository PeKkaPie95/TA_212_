# Automatic Punching Machine â€“ CAD Design and Fabrication

##  Course Info
- **Course**: TA212
- **Institute**: Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur
- **Guide**: Mr. Kishan Prajapati
- **Lab Support**: Dr. Arvind Kumar

##  Description
This project presents the design and fabrication of an Automatic Punching Machine that automates the process of creating holes in materials like sheet metal, plastic, and paper. By incorporating mechanical systems such as Geneva gears, spur gears, and electric motors, the machine provides a low-cost, efficient alternative to manual punching â€” ideal for repetitive and high-volume tasks.

##  Features
- Geneva mechanism for converting continuous to intermittent motion
- Spur gear system for torque and speed control
- Sprocket-chain drive for material movement
- Electrically powered operation
- Ideal for small-scale industrial and workshop applications

##  Motivation
Manual punching is labor-intensive, error-prone, and inconsistent. This project aims to reduce human effort and enhance precision using automation. It reflects the growing need to innovate even in basic operations like office tasks and industrial punching.
